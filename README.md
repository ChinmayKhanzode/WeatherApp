# Weather App

This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python and the `tkinter` library. The GUI takes a URL as input, makes a GET request to that URL when a button is clicked, and displays the response text in the GUI.

## Features

- Input field for entering a URL
- Submit button for sending the GET request
- Label for displaying the response text
- Progress bar that shows while the data is being fetched
